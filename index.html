      <h2>Tutorial</h2>
      <p>Welcome to The Generators.</p>
      <p>The power is out in the underground maintenance facility Axiga-9. You will need to enter manual override codes into
        the substation control panels by flipping switches to match each manual override code for each generator.</p>
      <p>Each manual override code is given in pairs of hexadecimal values such as DA C3</p>
      <p>Each switch represents a numerical value that is twice the value of the switch to it's right.</p>
      <p>The switch to the far right has a value of one.</p>
      <p>Flip switches to match the switch value with the value of the manual override code to power up the generator and move
        on to the next.</p>
      <p>If you enter a code incorrectly, you will trigger an error. There are only so many errors until you break the system
        and the game is over.</p>
      <p>Let's check out how this works:</p>
      <div>
        <p>The first pair in the manual override code is DA. This has a value of 218. You need to flip the switches to make
          the power value equal 218.
        </p>
        <p>Switch positions are numbered 1 to 8 from left to right</p>
        <p>Flip switch at position 1 to send 128 units of power to the generator.</p>
        <p>We need a total of 218 unit of power. We have 128 with the first switch flipped.</p>
        <p>Now subtract 128 from 218 and we get 90. So we need to flip the switch with the largest value that is less than or
          equal to 90.</p>
        <p>Remember that each switch has twice the value of the switch to it's right. We flipped the switch at position 1 and
          we got 128 units of power. So logical reasoning tells us that the switch at position 2 has a value that is half
          of position 1. So the switch at position 2 has a value of 64. 64 is less than 90, so flip it.</p>
        <p>By flipping switch 2, we now have 2 switches flipped which sends 192 units of power to the generator. We need 218
          units of power.</p>
        <p>Subtract 192 from 218 and we get 26. Using what we have learned, we can find the values of the switches we need to
          flip to send our needed 218 units of power to the generator.</p>
        <p>Switch at position 3 has a value half of switch at position 2, so that is 32 units of power which is too much since
          we only need 26. So we do not flip switch 3.</p>
        <p>Switch number 4 has a value of 16 and that is less than 26, so let's flip that one now and send a total of 208 units
          of power to the generator.</p>
        <p>Almost there. Subtract 208 from 218 and we get 10.</p>
        <p>The next switch has a value of 8, and that is less than 10. We need to flip it.</p>
        <p>We now have 216 units of power, and need 218. The last switch to flip is switch number 7 with a value of 2.</p>
        <p>If you were paying attention, you should have 5 switches flipped.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 - sends 128 units of power</li>
          <li>2 - sends 64 units of power</li>
          <li>4 - sends 16 units of power</li>
          <li>5 - sends 8 units of power</li>
          <li>7 - sends 2 units of power</li>
        </ul>
        <p>128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 218 units of power.</p>
        <p>And that is all there is to it! Go power those generators!</p>
